EssentialsX Development Readme
=============================

This is a fork of Essentials called EssentialsX.

If you are using this, do **NOT** ask Essentials for support.

The official upstream repository is at https://github.com/Essentials/Essentials

Building
--------
To build with Maven, use the command
```
mvn package dependency:copy
```

Jar files can then be found in the /jars folder


Commit Guidelines
-----------------

Commits should fall into one of 3 areas:

- `[Feature]`: Commits which are features should start with `[Feature]` and followed by a quick summary on the top line, followed by some extra details in the commit body.

- `[Fix]`: Commits which fix bugs, or minor improvements to existing features should start with `[Fix]` and followed by a quick summary on the top line, followed by some extra details in the commit body.

- Commits which fix bugs caused by previous commits (since last release), or otherwise make no functionality changes, should have no prefix.  These will not be added to the project change log.


Other advice
-----------------

Not all features are 'EssentialsX Ready'.  EssentialsX is designed to cover the basic needs of Minecraft server administration, thus, we reject over 80% of feature requests that we deem are unsuitable.

Before developing an EssentialsX feature, we would recommend speaking to a developer in the EssentialsX IRC channel ([#drtshock on irc.esper.net](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=drtshock&prompt=1)). Click [here](irc://irc.esper.net/#drtshock) if you have a IRC client.
